Here are all the dependencies called by main.f.

-- useful_constants.f defines a few mathematical and physical constants of interest.

-- res_arrays.f defines arrays of all the resonances' properties (such as mass, widths, spins, parities, ...).

-- model.f includes the subroutines to compute all the observables in our resonance model.

-- intx.f has integration subroutines.

-- coupling_mc.f reads the resonance electrocoupling data files in ../resbars/ and interpolates between Q^2 values.

-- resonance_files.f contains the subroutines to generate the observable files in ../Output/, as explained in the README of the main branch.
It creates all observables without uncertainties, including MC-sampled observables.

-- computer.f is needed for creating the mean and standard deviation from the MC-sampled observables generated by resonance_files.f.
